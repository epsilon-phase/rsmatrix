# RSMatrix

Kinda like cmatrix, but in rust, and janky as shit, and with a license that
with any luck, might make Richard Stallman roll around fitfully in his torrid
sleep :)

That being said, given that this is a terminal toy, you probably can't
capitalize on this in such a manner that it'd be against the NPL license.

In any case, run `cargo install` to install it, then `rsmatrix` to start it.
